###
Open protocols and ports between the hosts
The following ports must be available. On some systems, these ports are open by default.

TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications
TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes
UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic
If you are planning on creating an overlay network with encryption (--opt encrypted), you will also need to ensure ip protocol 50 (ESP) traffic is allowed.
