## Was Ist Das?

CRAWLZ seeks to develop a database of Businesses worldwide. It allows a company to build a local cache of business contact information using only the search results from its userâ€™s computing device.

## Architecture

This project is split into 5 containers, which can be scaled to fit processing tasks as defined by the user. We intend to atomize certain functions to introduce more scalablity and functionalities into the code base.

## Deployment

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRAWLZSTAGE/infra/master/docker-stack.yml > docker-stack.yml
docker stack deploy --compose-file=docker-stack.yml crawlz_stack
```
